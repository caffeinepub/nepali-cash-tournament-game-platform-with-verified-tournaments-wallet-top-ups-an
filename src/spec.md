# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the app’s branding to consistently use the name “Nepal Top Up Center” and apply a coherent new visual theme across the existing UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all user-facing app name branding in the header/logo area with “Nepal Top Up Center”.
- Update the browser tab title/metadata to “Nepal Top Up Center”.
- Adjust Tailwind/CSS theme tokens (colors, typography, backgrounds/surfaces) and apply consistent styling to core components (buttons, cards, inputs, tables) across existing pages: Dashboard, Tournaments, Wallet, Top Up, Withdraw, Admin.
- Ensure any newly introduced user-facing text is in English.

**User-visible outcome:** The app shows “Nepal Top Up Center” everywhere the brand name appears (including the browser tab), and the UI uses a consistent, refreshed theme across all main screens.
